#### [CV](/pages/files/CV_Antoine_Combremont.pdf) Updated Nov 2022

# Studies
I come from a small city in the french speaking part of Switzerland. In 2018 I left the shores of lake Neuch√¢tel for those of Zurich. I studied Computer Science at ETH for a few years, and more recently went on an exchange semester at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.

# Experiences and Projects
#### BACHELOR PROJECT
I wrote my thesis at the [research group of Prof. V. Boeva](http://boevalab.inf.ethz.ch) in the department of computer science of ETH Zurich. The goal of the project was to interpret the genetic expression inside of the ovarian cancer using machine learning, in order to assist with a personalized treatment. If you are interested you can read more about it in a dedicated [post](/posts/ovarian).

#### MILITARY
My most recent experience was the basic training for my mandatory military service. I discovered a lot about how to work with people sometimes under stressful conditions. But as the saying goes "At the military, you wait to run and you run to wait" and it was also a learning experience: to let go and just do the job. Read [my post](/posts/santa_barbara) to get more insight about it. 

#### LAUNCH 2021
In the course of 2021 I joined the [ETH Entrepreneur Club](https://eth.ec) to help the organization team of "_Launch by ETH Entrepreneur Club_", a new really cool event in Zurich. The goal of Launch is to bring the startup ecosystem of Zurich together for a one night event, with talks, workshops and booths. The first edition had a huge success with 1000+ participant, and the second edition in 2022 was even greater.  

# Others
#### Hobbies
I've been playing music üéπ for some time now, and even if I had to put it aside completely because of my studies, I still enjoy sitting at the piano from time to time. I would really like to do some musical project, maybe one day as a post. Same as with music, I've always been interested by visual arts üñåÔ∏è if I'm up to anything, I'll showcase it here.
